I am not a Computer Science major and this is my first time coding but i've always wanted to learn how to code. A microbiologist by academic training and I am currently working in the BioTech industry. Currently, I deal with a lot of data at my work so i am interested in learning Python and SQL as well in order to make sense of multitude of data. Dealing with multitude of data is one of the reason i wanted to learn how to code. Perhaps, become a Data Scientist later on. I am also interested in building a website on the side so I am currently enrolled in MIT Full Stack Development with MERN Bootcamp. I am hoping to start on my coding journey with this bootcamp with the intention on expanding my skills and/or starting a new career. My goal is to create multiple projects to add to my portfolio that will show the skills I have learned along the way.
